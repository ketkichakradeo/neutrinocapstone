# Majorana Neutrino Hunt Project

This repository contains the code for accessing the dataset and accessing the energy and the tail slope parameters.

To run the script, under the code.py folder, run the following command in your terminal. Replace the path with the path to the data on your computer.
```
python code.py ./path/to/data.hdf5
```

For example, if the data file is stored in a folder called data, navigate to:
```
python code.py ./data/MJD_Test_1.hdf5
```

The code will extract the energy and tail slope, plot the waveform, and open the plot in a new terminal window.


## Data

The data can be downloaded at the following [link](https://dataplanet.ucsd.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=perma:83.ucsddata/UQWQAV).
